# Available grid cell locations for the survey

Available grid cell locations that were used to choose the 2018 survey
locations for the WCGBTS. Cells are a truncated set compared to the full
set because of closures to trawlable areas such as what would be closed
because of a new management measure. In the future, this table should be
available from the data warehouse itself rather than a static snapshot
from a single year.

## Usage
