\arguments{
\item{dir}{Directory where output will be saved. The directory where the file should be saved.
If dir = NULL no output will be saved.}

\item{datA}{the biological data frame extracted from the data warehouse using the \code{\link[=pull_bio]{pull_bio()}}}

\item{datTows}{the catch data frame extracted from the data warehouse using the \code{\link[=pull_catch]{pull_catch()}}}

\item{strat.vars}{Variables in both data frame that are used to
define the strata. Default is bottom depth (m) and latitudes (decimal
degrees), i.e., \code{c("Depth_m", "Latitude_dd")}.}

\item{strat.df}{A data frame that defines the strata and provides the
calculated areas for each strata returned from \code{\link[=createStrataDF.fn]{createStrataDF.fn()}}.}

\item{ageBins}{Vector of age bins to create age compositions across. Values above or below the
minimum or maximum values, respectively, are grouped into the first age or plus group age.}

\item{SSout}{A logical with the default of \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE}, the output
is returned in a format that can be directly pasted into an SS3 data file.}

\item{meanRatioMethod}{A logical with the default of \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE}, then
the mean ratio is implemented instead of the total ratio. Search the
source code for the equations if more information is needed.}

\item{sex}{Options of (0, 1, 2, 3). The integer will be used to define the sex column
of the returned input for Stock Synthesis and specifies how the
composition are treated with respect to sex. See the Stock Synthesis
manual for more information. In short, 0 is for unsexed, 1 is females, 2
is males, and 3 is females and males. The default is \code{3}.}

\item{NAs2zero}{A logical specifying if \code{NA}s should be changed to zeros.
The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{sexRatioUnsexed}{sex ratio to apply to any length bins of a certain size or smaller as defined
by the maxSizeUnsexed}

\item{maxSizeUnsexed}{all sizes below this threshold will assign unsexed fish by sexRatio set equal to 0.50, fish larger than this size will have unsexed fish assigned by the calculated sex ratio in the data.}

\item{sexRatioStage}{1/2 apply the sex ratio based on the tows (1) or the expanded numbers (2)}

\item{partition}{Partition to assign the composition data based on the expected
format for Stock Synthesis. Partition of 0 indicates that the composition data
include all composition data, 1 for discarded composition data, and 2 for retained
fish only. Default of 0.}

\item{fleet}{A single integer value. A user input fleet
number to assign to the fleet column based on the expected
format for Stock Synthesis. Default "Enter Fleet".}

\item{agelow}{Lower age bin for all age composition data based on the expected
format for Stock Synthesis. Default value of -1 which translates to the lowest age
bin.}

\item{agehigh}{Upper age bin for all age composition data based on the expected
format for Stock Synthesis. Default value of -1 which translates to the highest}

\item{ageErr}{Single integer value  of ageing error
vector to apply to the age data based on
Stock Synthesis. Default "Enter".}

\item{nSamps}{Vector of integer sample sizes. A vector of sample sizes for
all years in \code{datA} is required if a vector is provided. The input vector will be included in the
output marginal age composition data.  One option for calculating input sample size is the \code{\link[=GetN.fn]{GetN.fn()}}.
The default is "Enter Samps".}

\item{month}{A single integer value between 1-12. A user input fleet
number to assign to the month column based on the expected
format for Stock Synthesis. See the Stock Synthesis manual for
more information. Default "Enter Month".}

\item{printfolder}{A string that will be appended to \code{dir}, creating a folder
where the output will be saved. If specified as \code{""},
the output will just be saved directly in \code{dir}. The default is \code{"forSS3"}.}

\item{remove999}{The output object by the function will have the 999 column combined with the first age bin.
Default TRUE.}

\item{outputStage1}{return the first stage expanded data without compiling it for SS3}

\item{verbose}{A logical that specifies if you want to print messages and
warnings to the console. The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\description{
Create marginal age composition data
}
\details{
Create expanded marginal age composition data based on the pre-specified strata.
This function is designed to be used with catch pulled using \code{\link[=pull_catch]{pull_catch()}} and
biological data pulled using \code{\link[=pull_bio]{pull_bio()}}. The default output is formatted based
on the formatting required by Stock Synthesis.
