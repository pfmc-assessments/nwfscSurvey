\usage{
plot_comps(
  data,
  dir = NULL,
  add_save_name = NULL,
  plot = 1:2,
  add_0_ylim = TRUE,
  width = 10,
  height = 7
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data file object created by \code{\link[=SurveyLF.fn]{SurveyLF.fn()}} or \code{\link[=SurveyAF.fn]{SurveyAF.fn()}}.}

\item{dir}{Directory to save files to. The default is \code{NULL}, which leads to
the figures being printed to the screen rather than saved. If a path is
provided, then the figures will only be saved, i.e., not printed.}

\item{add_save_name}{Option to add text to a saved figure name. This option
can be useful if creating plots across multiple species and saving them
into a single folder. The default is \code{NULL}. Note that the data type,
i.e., age or length, and sex type are already included in the saved name
so no need to add those here.}

\item{plot}{A vector of integers to specify which plots you would like. The
default is to print or save both figures, i.e., \code{plot = 1:2}. Integers
correspond to the following figures:
\enumerate{
\item bubble plot of length-/age-composition data by year and sex and
\item distribution by year of length-/age-compositions data similar to the
r4ss figure.
}}

\item{add_0_ylim}{A logical, i.e., \code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE}, argument that specifies
if the y axis should start at 0. If \code{FALSE}, the y axis will start at the
minimum bin size used in data. The default is TRUE. This currently only
pertains to plot 1, not plot 2.}

\item{width, height}{Numeric values for the figure width and height in
inches. The defaults are 10 by 7 inches.}
