}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame of catches obtained by using the \code{pull_catch}
function.}

\item{dir}{Directory where output will be saved. The directory where the file should be saved.
If dir = NULL no output will be saved.}

\description{
Combine catch data by \code{trawl_id} for data pulled using the
pull_catch function. Generally, only a single tow is returned
by species and in those instances this function is not needed.
For example, if data are pulled with all sample_types included,
then there will often be data from the same \code{trawl_id} included
as multiple records. In these instances, this function allows
for the sample data to be combined for each unique \code{trawl_id}.
