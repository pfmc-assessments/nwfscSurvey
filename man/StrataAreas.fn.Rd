\usage{
StrataAreas.fn(
  strat.df,
  df = get(utils::data("SA3_v2021.1", overwrite = TRUE, package = "nwfscSurvey"))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{strat.df}{A data frame describing the strata names and boundaries.
Boundaries are determined by latitude and bottom depth with
Latitude_dd.1 and Latitude_dd.2 being the
low and high bound for north to south and
Depth_m.1 and Depth_m.2 being the
low and high bound for east to west.
A column of \code{area} can also be included if users want this column to
be located in a certain order within the data frame, but it is not necessary.}

\item{df}{The stored data frame or a personally created data frame that
is used to calculate areas for the West Coast stratifications. The default
data frame can be accessed using \code{utils::data("SA3_v2021.1")}.}
}
\value{
Returns the \code{strat.df} with entries in the area column containing
the area (square km) for each strata.
}
\description{
Calculate the area of your strata desired strata using the SA3_v2021.1.rda file
(included with this package and accessible via \code{utils::data("SA3_v2021.1")}).
Default areas are available for each of 1756 combinations of
latitude and depth.
Latitude breaks must fall on 0.5 degree breaks from 32.5 to 49.0 and
depth breaks must be from the set (55, 75, 100, 125, 155,
183, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 549, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000,
1100, 1200, 1280), where the unevenly spaced values are due to depth
boundaries associated with the strata used in the survey sampling design.
