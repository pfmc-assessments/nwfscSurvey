\usage{
Biomass.fn(
  dir = NULL,
  dat,
  strat.vars = c("Depth_m", "Latitude_dd"),
  strat.df,
  printfolder = "forSS3",
  outputMedian = TRUE,
  month = "Enter month",
  fleet = "Enter fleet",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{Directory where output will be saved. The directory where the file should be saved.
If dir = NULL no output will be saved.}

\item{dat}{Data frame of catch data that has been created by the \code{\link[=pull_catch]{pull_catch()}}.}

\item{strat.vars}{Variables in both data frame that are used to
define the strata. Default is bottom depth (m) and latitudes (decimal
degrees), i.e., \code{c("Depth_m", "Latitude_dd")}.}

\item{strat.df}{A data frame that defines the strata and provides the
calculated areas for each strata returned from \code{\link[=createStrataDF.fn]{createStrataDF.fn()}}.}

\item{printfolder}{A string that will be appended to \code{dir}, creating a folder
where the output will be saved. If specified as \code{""},
the output will just be saved directly in \code{dir}. The default is \code{"forSS3"}.}

\item{outputMedian}{Logical input to specify whether to output median or the
mean biomass estimate. Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{month}{A single integer value between 1-12. A user input fleet
number to assign to the month column based on the expected
format for Stock Synthesis. See the Stock Synthesis manual for
more information. Default "Enter Month".}

\item{fleet}{A single integer value. A user input fleet
number to assign to the fleet column based on the expected
format for Stock Synthesis. Default "Enter Fleet".}

\item{verbose}{A logical that specifies if you want to print messages and
warnings to the console. The default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
List of biomass estimates by year, biomass estimates by year and
strata, and numbers of fish by year.

\description{
Calculates design based estimates from survey data for West Coast surveys.
}
\details{
The design based index is calculated based on the area of the strata and
the mean catch by strata. This function returns a list of design-based
estimates by strata and estimates combined across strata by year. This
function is designed to work with data frames pulled from the NWFSC
data warehouse using \code{\link[=pull_catch]{pull_catch()}}.

Oregon, and California during 1977. Marine Fisheries Review: March - April.
