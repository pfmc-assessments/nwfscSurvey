\usage{
get_design_based(
  data,
  strata,
  CI = 0.95,
  dir = NULL,
  month = NA,
  fleet = NA,
  printfolder = "forSS3",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame of catch data that has been created by the \code{\link[=pull_catch]{pull_catch()}}.}

\item{strata}{A data frame that defines the strata and provides the
calculated areas for each strata returned from \code{\link[=createStrataDF.fn]{createStrataDF.fn()}}.}

\item{CI}{A numerical value that specifies the confidence interval to return.
Values should be between 0.01 to 0.99.}

\item{dir}{Directory where output will be saved. The directory where the file should be saved.
If dir = NULL no output will be saved.}

\item{month}{A single integer value between 1-12. A user input fleet
number to assign to the month column based on the expected
format for Stock Synthesis. See the Stock Synthesis manual for
more information. Default "Enter Month".}

\item{fleet}{A single integer value. A user input fleet
number to assign to the fleet column based on the expected
format for Stock Synthesis. Default "Enter Fleet".}

\item{printfolder}{A string that will be appended to \code{dir}, creating a folder
where the output will be saved. If specified as \code{""},
the output will just be saved directly in \code{dir}. The default is \code{"forSS3"}.}

\item{verbose}{A logical that specifies if you want to print messages and
warnings to the console. The default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
List of biomass estimates by year and biomass estimates by year and
strata. The biomass estimates are in metric tons.
}
\description{
Calculates design based estimates from survey data for West Coast surveys.
}
\details{
The design based index is calculated based on the area of the strata with the
output estimates representing the adjusted median estimates
(e.g., est * exp(0.5*log(var)). This function returns a list of design-based
estimates by strata and estimates combined across strata by year. This
function is designed to work with data frames pulled from the NWFSC
data warehouse using \code{\link[=pull_catch]{pull_catch()}}.

Oregon, and California during 1977. Marine Fisheries Review: March - April.
