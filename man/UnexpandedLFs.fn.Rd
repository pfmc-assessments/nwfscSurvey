\title{Creates a matrix of unexpanded length composition data}
\usage{
UnexpandedLFs.fn(
  dir = NULL,
  datL,
  lgthBins = 1,
  sex = 3,
  partition = 0,
  fleet = "Enter Fleet",
  ageErr = "NA",
  agelow = -1,
  agehigh = -1,
  month = "Enter Month",
  printfolder = "forSS3",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{Directory where output will be saved. The directory where the file should be saved.
If dir = NULL no output will be saved.}

\item{datL}{A data frame of length-composition data returned from
\code{\link[=pull_bio]{pull_bio()}}.}

\item{lgthBins}{Vector of length bins to create length compositions across. Values above or below the
minimum or maximum values, respectively, are grouped into the first size or plus group size.}

\item{sex}{Options of (0, 1, 2, 3). The integer will be used to define the sex column
of the returned input for Stock Synthesis and specifies how the
composition are treated with respect to sex. See the Stock Synthesis
manual for more information. In short, 0 is for unsexed, 1 is females, 2
is males, and 3 is females and males. The default is \code{3}.}

\item{partition}{Partition to assign the composition data based on the expected
format for Stock Synthesis. Partition of 0 indicates that the composition data
include all composition data, 1 for discarded composition data, and 2 for retained
fish only. Default of 0.}

\item{fleet}{A single integer value. A user input fleet
number to assign to the fleet column based on the expected
format for Stock Synthesis. Default "Enter Fleet".}

\item{ageErr}{Single integer value  of ageing error
vector to apply to the age data based on
Stock Synthesis. Default "Enter".}

\item{agelow}{Lower age bin for all age composition data based on the expected
format for Stock Synthesis. Default value of -1 which translates to the lowest age
bin.}

\item{agehigh}{Upper age bin for all age composition data based on the expected
format for Stock Synthesis. Default value of -1 which translates to the highest}

\item{month}{A single integer value between 1-12. A user input fleet
number to assign to the month column based on the expected
format for Stock Synthesis. See the Stock Synthesis manual for
more information. Default "Enter Month".}

\item{printfolder}{A string that will be appended to \code{dir}, creating a folder
where the output will be saved. If specified as \code{""},
the output will just be saved directly in \code{dir}. The default is \code{"forSS3"}.}

\item{verbose}{A logical that specifies if you want to print messages and
warnings to the console. The default is \code{TRUE}.}
