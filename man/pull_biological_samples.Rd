\title{Pull biological sample information from the NWFSC data warehouse for biological
collections taken at sea. Generally these are samples that require lab processing.
Generally, these types of biological sample are maturity, stomach, fin clips, and
tissue samples. This function returns collection information for these samples
include the sample numbers which allows the lab analysis to be linked back to
the sampled fish.

\arguments{
\item{survey}{A character entry from one of the following options that
specifies which survey to pull the data for. The input options are:
\itemize{
\item Triennial,
\item AFSC.Slope,
\item NWFSC.Combo,
\item NWFSC.Slope,
\item NWFSC.Shelf,
\item NWFSC.Hypoxia,
\item NWFSC.Santa.Barb.Basin,
\item NWFSC.Shelf.Rockfish (not yet working),
\item NWFSC.Hook.Line (not yet working),
\item NWFSC.Video,
\item Triennial.Canada
}

The National Marine Fishery Service Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC)
Triennial survey was conducted between 1977 - 2004 occurring every 3rd year.
The initial year, 1977, survey is not traditionally used in calculating
indices of abundance. The Triennial survey sampled areas within the Canadian
EEZ on the West Coast of Vancouver Island in 1980 - 2001 but these data are
associated with a different survey name "Triennial.Canada".
The AFSC Slope Survey (AFSC.Slope) along the west coast of the U.S. began in 1984 and occurred
annually from 1988-2001, with the exception of 1994 and 1998, when surveys were not conducted.
Prior to 1997, only a limited portion of the coast was covered in each year.
U.S. West Coast groundfish stock assessments only use the four years of consistent
and complete survey coverage (1997, 1999-2001). The Northwest Fisheries Science
Center (NWFSC) Slope survey (NWFSC.Slope) was conducted between 1998 - 2001.
The NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl survey (NWFSC.Combo) is conducted
annually starting in 2003 (excluding 2020) and samples both the U.S. west coast
shelf and slope between 55 - 1,280 meters.
Data can only be pulled from one survey at a time, though we are working on
allowing for a vector of survey names.
Currently, \code{NWFSC.Shelf.Rockfish} and \code{NWFSC.Hook.Line} are not supported.}

\item{common_name}{A character entry with the desired common name of the
species you want to pull data for from the data warehouse.
Use a vector of names if you want information for more than one species or
if the desired species is included in the database using more than one name,
e.g., vermilion rockfish (see the example below).
Use the \code{sci_name} argument if you know the latin name.}

\item{sci_name}{A character entry with the desired scientific name of the
species you want to pull data for from the data warehouse.
Use a vector of names if you want information for more than one species or
if the desired species is included in the database using more than one name,
e.g., vermilion rockfish (see the example below).
Use the \code{common_name} argument if you know the common name.}

\item{years}{An integer vector of length two with the
range of years to pull data for (e.g., c(2003, 2024)).
Vector can not contain -Inf or Inf.}

\item{dir}{Directory where output will be saved. The directory where the file should be saved.
If dir = NULL no output will be saved.}

\item{verbose}{A logical that specifies if you want to print messages and
warnings to the console. The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{standard_filtering}{A logical TRUE/FALSE that specifies whether data
should be filtered using the standard filtering which removes tows with bad
performance (water haul or poor net performance), or stations that have been
removed from the survey sampling protocol.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame of special biological samples with sample number
