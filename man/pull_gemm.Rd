\title{Pull Groundfish Expanded Multiyear Mortality data}
\usage{
pull_gemm(common_name, years, dir = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{common_name}{A character entry with the desired common name of the
species you want to pull data for from the data warehouse.
Use a vector of names if you want information for more than one species or
if the desired species is included in the database using more than one name,
e.g., vermilion rockfish (see the example below).
Use the \code{sci_name} argument if you know the latin name.}

\item{years}{An integer vector of length two with the
range of years to pull data for (e.g., c(2003, 2024)).
Vector can not contain -Inf or Inf.}

\item{dir}{Directory where output will be saved. The directory where the file should be saved.
If dir = NULL no output will be saved.}

\item{verbose}{A logical that specifies if you want to print messages and
warnings to the console. The default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\description{
The data are being pulled from: https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/gemm_csv/
This function can be used to pull all gemm data, a single species, or a
subset of species c("Canary Rockfish", "Widow Rockfish"). Species names in
the gemm are capitalized (e.g. Canary Rockfish). However, there are checks in
the function to adjust input species names if the input names do not match
the expected capitalization (e.g. "canary rockfish", "canary_rockfish"). The
function also allows you to subset the data by year using the years input and
to save the object if the dir function input is given.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Pull all GEMM data
all_data <- pull_gemm()

# Pull for a specific specis
widow_data <- pull_gemm(common_name = "widow rockfish")

# Pull multiple species
data <- pull_gemm(common_name = c("Widow Rockfish", "Canary Rockfish"))

# Pull species and subset years
widow_recent <- pull_gemm(common_name = "Widow Rockfish", years = 2014:2019)
