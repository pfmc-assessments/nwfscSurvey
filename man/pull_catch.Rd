\arguments{
\item{survey}{A character entry from one of the following options that
specifies which survey to pull the data for. The input options are:
\itemize{
\item Triennial,
\item AFSC.Slope,
\item NWFSC.Combo,
\item NWFSC.Slope,
\item NWFSC.Shelf,
\item NWFSC.Hypoxia,
\item NWFSC.Santa.Barb.Basin,
\item NWFSC.Shelf.Rockfish (not yet working),
\item NWFSC.Hook.Line (not yet working),
\item NWFSC.Video,
\item Triennial.Canada
}

The National Marine Fishery Service Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC)
Triennial survey was conducted between 1977 - 2004 occurring every 3rd year.
The initial year, 1977, survey is not traditionally used in calculating
indices of abundance. The Triennial survey sampled areas within the Canadian
EEZ on the West Coast of Vancouver Island in 1980 - 2001 but these data are
associated with a different survey name "Triennial.Canada".
The AFSC Slope Survey (AFSC.Slope) along the west coast of the U.S. began in 1984 and occurred
annually from 1988-2001, with the exception of 1994 and 1998, when surveys were not conducted.
Prior to 1997, only a limited portion of the coast was covered in each year.
U.S. West Coast groundfish stock assessments only use the four years of consistent
and complete survey coverage (1997, 1999-2001). The Northwest Fisheries Science
Center (NWFSC) Slope survey (NWFSC.Slope) was conducted between 1998 - 2001.
The NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl survey (NWFSC.Combo) is conducted
annually starting in 2003 (excluding 2020) and samples both the U.S. west coast
shelf and slope between 55 - 1,280 meters.
Data can only be pulled from one survey at a time, though we are working on
allowing for a vector of survey names.
Currently, \code{NWFSC.Shelf.Rockfish} and \code{NWFSC.Hook.Line} are not supported.}

\item{common_name}{A character entry with the desired common name of the
species you want to pull data for from the data warehouse.
Use a vector of names if you want information for more than one species or
if the desired species is included in the database using more than one name,
e.g., vermilion rockfish (see the example below).
Use the \code{sci_name} argument if you know the latin name.}

\item{sci_name}{A character entry with the desired scientific name of the
species you want to pull data for from the data warehouse.
Use a vector of names if you want information for more than one species or
if the desired species is included in the database using more than one name,
e.g., vermilion rockfish (see the example below).
Use the \code{common_name} argument if you know the common name.}

\item{years}{An integer vector of length two with the
range of years to pull data for (e.g., c(2003, 2024)).
Vector can not contain -Inf or Inf.}

\item{dir}{Directory where output will be saved. The directory where the file should be saved.
If dir = NULL no output will be saved.}

\item{convert}{TRUE/FALSE to convert column names to first letter uppercase
which aligns with the expected names in data processing functions.}

\item{verbose}{A logical that specifies if you want to print messages and
warnings to the console. The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{sample_types}{A character vector of sample types, i.e.,
\code{"statistical_partition_dim"}, that you would like to keep. The default is
to only keep \code{NA} values, both real and character NA. But, for some
instances you may want to keep Life Stage and Size samples. The majority
of samples with \code{"statistical_partition_dim"} of Size and Life Stage are
Pacific hake and should not be considered different than regular survey
samples. The other types of samples that may be designated Life Stage are
egg cases that can be caught and identified for select elasmobranch
species. These type of samples should not be included in the data used
to estimate indices of abundance and are omitted by default.}

\item{standard_filtering}{A logical TRUE/FALSE that specifies whether data
should be filtered using the standard filtering which removes tows with bad
performance (water haul or poor net performance), or stations that have been
removed from the survey sampling protocol.}

\description{
Pull catch data from the
\href{https://www.webapps.nwfsc.noaa.gov/data}{NWFSC data warehouse}
for a single species or all observed species, where the latter is specified
by leaving both \code{common_name = NULL} and \code{sci_name = NULL}.
}
\details{
The data available in the warehouse are cleaned prior to being downloaded
with the intent that they provide the best available information for use
in an index-standardization procedure. The removed samples may be of use
to others with a less-restrictive goal than producing an index of abundance.
For example, depths sampled outside the standard protocol are excluded.
To download all data, we currently recommend going to the
\href{https://www.webapps.nwfsc.noaa.gov/data}{NWFSC data warehouse}
and using the csv link to extract data for a single species at a time.
In the future, we hope to add functionality to this package such that
downloading all data can be done easily within this function.
