#' Pull catch data from the NWFSC data warehouse
#'
#' Pull catch data from the
#' [NWFSC data warehouse](https://www.webapps.nwfsc.noaa.gov/data)
#' for a single species or all observed species, where the latter is specified
#' by leaving both `Name = NULL` and `SciName = NULL`.
#'
#' @details
#' The data available in the warehouse are cleaned prior to being downloaded
#' with the intent that they provide the best available information for use
#' in an index-standardization procedure. The removed samples may be of use
#' to others with a less-restrictive goal than producing an index of abundance.
#' For example, life-stage samples are excluded because they are not collected
#' using the same protocols as standard samples.
#' To download all data, we currently recommend going to the
#' [NWFSC data warehouse](https://www.webapps.nwfsc.noaa.gov/data)
#' and using the csv link to extract data for a single species at a time.
#' In the future, we hope to add functionality to this package such that
#' downloading all data can be done easily within this function.
#' See [Issue #43](https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/nwfscSurvey/issues/43)
#' for more information.
#'
#' @param Name A character entry with the desired common name of the
#' species you want to pull data for from the data warehouse.
#' Use a vector of names if you want information for more than one species or
#' if the desired species is included in the database using more than one name,
#' e.g., vermilion rockfish (see the example below).
#' Use the `SciName` argument if you know the latin name.
#' @param SciName A character entry with the desired scientific name of the
#' species you want to pull data for from the data warehouse.
#' Use a vector of names if you want information for more than one species or
#' if the desired species is included in the database using more than one name,
#' e.g., vermilion rockfish (see the example below).
#' Use the `Name` argument if you know the common name.
#' @param YearRange An integer vector of length two with the
#' range of years to pull data for.
#' @param SurveyName A character entry from one of the following options that
#' specifies which survey to pull the data for:
#'   * Triennial,
#'   * AFSC.Slope,
#'   * NWFSC.Combo,
#'   * NWFSC.Slope,
#'   * NWFSC.Shelf,
#'   * NWFSC.Hypoxia,
#'   * NWFSC.Santa.Barb.Basin,
#'   * NWFSC.Shelf.Rockfish (not yet working),
#'   * NWFSC.Hook.Line (not yet working),
#'   * NWFSC.Video,
#'   * Triennial.Canada
#'
#' Currently, you must pull data one survey at a time, though we are working on
#' allowing for a vector of survey names and
#' `NWFSC.Shelf.Rockfish` and `NWFSC.Hook.Line` are not supported.
#' The default of `NULL` is a placeholder that must be replaced with an entry.
#' @param SaveFile Deprecated with {nwfscSurvey} 2.3. Output will be save automatically
#'   if the Dir input is specified.
#' @param Dir The directory where you want the output file to be saved.
#'   The name of the file within `Dir` will start with Catch_ and end with .rdata.
#'   Default NULL which will not save an output file.
