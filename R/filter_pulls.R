#' Filter data pulls
#'
#' Function to create messages on data that are outside the standard survey protocol
#' and to remove these samples if `standard_filtering` = TRUE. The data are checked
#' for tow performance, valid stations, and depth range. This function is called
#' within the pull functions, but can be called on pulled data frames if filtering
#' was not selected in the original data pull.
#'
#' @param data Data frame of pulled data created by the [pull_catch()], [pull_bio()],
#'   [pull_haul()], or [pull_biological_samples].
#' @param data_type Character string to include within data filtering messages
#'   to indicate the type of data being filtered such as "biological samples".
#'   Default is "samples".
#' @param standard_filtering A logical TRUE/FALSE that specifies whether data
#'   should be filtered using the standard filtering which removes tows with bad
#'   performance (water haul or poor net performance), or stations that have been
#'   removed from the survey sampling protocol.
